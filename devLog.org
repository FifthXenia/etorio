*** 10:02, decided to do game jam (T-06day:10hours:56minutes)
- Can use elisp, can use artwork, from others.

  - Has decent pixel art glyphs, can use. Need to figuer out how they are drawing to screen. Looks like the create a new buffer for the game, and somehow draw to it.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
  (let ((buf (get-buffer ducpel-buffer-name)))
    (pop-to-buffer-same-window ducpel-buffer-name)
#+end_src

- Has a somewhat factorio like belt-effect, draw pixels which is what I would be doing, can look at their guile code.

*** Ideas:
- Play ~10-21-23.wav~ at 0.42x, have speed increment up a notch each time you reach a point bracket. Stop at 1.00x. Display score also in text, and music modifier speed. Maybe also speed up belts as score hits a point.
  - Score based on amount of output, and production statically configured. Not related to speed. (So as it speeds up, your score does not go up. Speed is just an additional visual indicator of score, etc, relates to melody speed.)

*** ducpel does not render art:

*** But Sokoban does, so I will reference their code.
