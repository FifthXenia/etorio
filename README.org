Making a very basic sokoban factorio game, inside emacs using elisp, within the time constraints of 6 days 11 hours, for the 10-day lisp game jam: https://itch.io/jam/autumn-lisp-game-jam-2023
- I'm not too versed in elisp, nor emacs package creation, so we will see what I can come up with.

- ~Some progress made, but left the game jam, and will complete the game later, when I feel interested in it again.~
  - Has maps and graphics, but needs collisions, movement, scoring. So needs a bit more.
    - (When I pick this up again, watch the ~Writing Games with Emacs~, as it has good notes on indexing rows and columns: 1 - ~line-number-at-pos~ for rows, ~current-column~ for cols.)
