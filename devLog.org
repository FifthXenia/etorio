*** 10:02, decided to do game jam (T-06day:10hours:56minutes)
- Can use elisp, can use artwork, from others.

  - Has decent pixel art glyphs, can use. Need to figuer out how they are drawing to screen. Looks like the create a new buffer for the game, and somehow draw to it.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
  (let ((buf (get-buffer ducpel-buffer-name)))
    (pop-to-buffer-same-window ducpel-buffer-name)
#+end_src
